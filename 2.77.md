# 2.77

```scheme
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents args))
          (error
            "No method for these types: APPLY-GENERIC"
            (list op type-tags))))))

(define (magnitude x)
  (apply-generic 'magnitude x))
```
Looking at `apply-generic`, we can see that the value of `proc` is `(get op
type-tags)`, which in this case is `'(complex)`, and is not defined.

However, after running the following commands

```
(put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude)
(put 'real-part '(complex) real-part)
(put 'imag-part '(complex) imag-part)
```

When running `(magnitude z)`, Then the value of `pro` is going to be `(get
'magnitude '(complex)`, which will result it *another `apply-generic`* with the
*contents* of `z` as an argument, in other words, `apply-generic` will run `z`
with either the `polar` or `rectangular` tag instead of the `complex` tag.

In general, for an $n$ tagged data type, `apply-generic` will run $n$ times.
