# Generic with explicit dispatch (stupid)

- New Data type: Generic operations must be updated with more explicit dispatches

- New Operators: Must create explicit dispatches for all data types to make it
  the operation generic.

# Data directed style (tagged data, put table, apply-generic)

- New Data type: Create constructor, tag it appropriately, register it in the
  table.

- New Operators: Create selector, tag it appropriately, register it in the
  table.

Be careful with name clashes, use internal procedures.

# Message passing

- New Data type: Nothing must be modified, because the *constructor and the
  operators are one*

- New Operators: All data types must be updated to include the new operators

# Conclusion

Lots of data types in the system? Use message passing style, quite simple and
effective.

Lots of operators? Use data directed style. Data directed style is
good for both data types and operators, but it requires a table and tagging.

Don't use generic with explicit dispatch ~~it sucks~~
