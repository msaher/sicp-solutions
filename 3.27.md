We already know that `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`. If we expand this we will get
`fib(n) = 2*fib(n-2) + fib(n-3)`. The recursive Fibonacci program will evaluate
`2*fib(n-1)` twice. However, `memo-fib` will only evaluate it once. Therefore
the only time used it the time for expanding the expressions, which is `2` for
each iteration and `1` for the last iteration. Therefore `o(n) = 2n - 1`.

defining `memo-fib` as `(memo fib)` will not work because `fib` does not make
use of the table. Only `memo-fib` would but no each call of `fib` itself.
